# CPP-Qt-Snippets 

![Qt-Logo](/qt_logo.png?raw=true)

### About
This repository contains snippets of code that I use for 
development using Qt Framework. This includes different 
library usages, call to external scripts and APIs that I 
made so I won't write it again from scratch if I needed it 
for other purposes. This will make my development for other 
projects faster since I will just refer to the snippets 
I made previously.

This does not contain complete projects but only a "snippet" 
that can be used for bigger projects in the future.

I mainly used Qt4 because I used it in some projects
which requires those version rather than using the latest Qt5.
